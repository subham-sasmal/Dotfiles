Issues:
	1. If Alt+F1/F2/F3 is not working for controlling the volume output, check if amixer is present in /usr/bin/ or not. If is not present then download amixer and if amixer is not available to download, download something similar to amixer like pamixer and replace amixer with pamixer in the key binding section.
	2. If bluetooth is not working, check if blueman is installed or not, if not, then install it using: pamac install blueman.
